**1.2 Finite Information Axiom: Proof of Finite Hilbert Space Dimension for Physical Reality**

In Section 1.1, we established an upper bound on entropy of local physical systems through the Bekenstein Bound. This section elevates this thermodynamic conclusion to a core axiom of quantum mechanics, rigorously proving that the Hilbert Space of physical reality must be finite-dimensional in any bounded region. This conclusion forms the mathematical cornerstone of "discrete ontology" in this book, marking a paradigm shift in physics from infinite-dimensional analysis (Functional Analysis) based on continuum to linear algebra (Linear Algebra) based on finite-dimensional algebras.

### 1.2.1 From Entropy Bound to State Space Dimension

In standard quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is usually assumed to be infinite-dimensional. For example, even a simple free particle in a one-dimensional interval $[0, L]$ has energy eigenstates $|n\rangle$ with quantum number $n$ taking values in $\mathbb{N}$, forming a countably infinite-dimensional space; if we consider continuous position representation $|x\rangle$, the dimension becomes uncountably infinite.

However, this mathematical infinity directly leads to divergence of entropy. For a Hilbert space of dimension $D$, the maximum possible von Neumann Entropy is:

$$S_{\max} = k_B \ln D$$

If $D \to \infty$, then $S_{\max} \to \infty$.

**Lemma 1.2.1 (Relationship between Dimension and Information Capacity)**:

If the maximum information content (entropy) that a physical system can carry in spatial region $\mathcal{R}$ is constrained by Bekenstein bound $S_{\text{Bek}}$, then the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{R}}$ describing complete physical states of this system must be finite-dimensional, and dimension $D$ satisfies:

$$D \le \exp\left(\frac{S_{\text{Bek}}}{k_B}\right) = \exp\left(\frac{A_{\partial \mathcal{R}}}{4l_P^2}\right)$$

**Physical Interpretation**:

This means that within a given volume, even if we push energy to the limit of black hole formation, the number of orthogonal quantum states we can distinguish is finite. The so-called "infinite dimension" is not an attribute of physical reality, but redundancy introduced by mathematical models (continuum hypothesis).

### 1.2.2 Finiteness Theorem for Hilbert Space Dimension

Based on the above lemma and conclusions of Section 1.1, we formally propose and prove the **Finiteness Theorem for Hilbert Space Dimension**.

**Theorem 1.2.2 (Finiteness Theorem)**:

Let $\mathcal{U}$ be a causally closed bounded subregion of the universe (Causal Diamond), with boundary being a compact two-dimensional surface $\partial \mathcal{U}$ of area $A$. If we accept the holographic principle (Axiom A1) as a fundamental constraint of physics, then the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{U}}$ generated by all local observable algebras $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{U})$ supported on $\mathcal{U}$ must be a finite-dimensional space.

**Proof**:

We use proof by contradiction.

1. **Assumption**: Assume $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{U}}$ is infinite-dimensional.

2. **Orthogonal Basis Construction**: By definition of infinite-dimensional space, there exists a set $\{|\psi_i\rangle\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ containing infinitely many orthonormal states, satisfying $\langle\psi_i|\psi_j\rangle = \delta_{ij}$.

3. **Mixed State Construction**: Consider the maximally mixed state composed of first $N$ basis states:

    $$\rho_N = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|$$

    Its von Neumann entropy is $S(\rho_N) = k_B \ln N$.

4. **Energy Constraint Analysis**: In quantum field theory, dimension is usually limited by imposing energy cutoff. However, if space is infinite-dimensional and there is no fundamental minimum length limit, we can always excite arbitrarily high-energy modes at arbitrarily small scales (UV divergence). But according to general relativity, when local energy density exceeds a certain threshold, region $\mathcal{U}$ will collapse into a black hole.

    The black hole itself is the stable configuration with highest energy and entropy in region $\mathcal{U}$. According to Bekenstein-Hawking formula, this maximum entropy is finite $S_{\text{BH}} = \frac{k_B A}{4l_P^2}$.

5. **Contradiction Derivation**: Since $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{U}}$ should contain all possible physical processes in this region (including gravitational collapse), $\rho_N$ must be a legitimate density matrix on $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{U}}$. When $N$ is large enough such that $k_B \ln N > S_{\text{BH}}$, we have constructed a state with entropy exceeding the black hole entropy of this region. This violates the generalized second law of thermodynamics (or Bekenstein bound).

6. **Conclusion**: The assumption is false. Therefore, dimension $D$ of $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{U}}$ must be finite, and $D \le e^{S_{\text{BH}}/k_B}$.

$\square$

### 1.2.3 Formal Statement of Finite Information Axiom

In view of the above theorem, we elevate finiteness to the second core axiom of this book. This should not be seen as a correction to standard quantum mechanics, but as its strictification in gravitational background.

**Axiom A2 (Finite Information Axiom)**:

The Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\text{phys}}$ of physical reality is isomorphic to a finite-dimensional vector space $\mathbb{C}^D$ over complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ on any compact spatial region.

In particular, for systems defined by discrete grid $\Lambda$, the state space of the entire system is a tensor product of local finite-dimensional spaces:

$$\mathcal{H}_{\text{total}} = \bigotimes_{x \in \Lambda} \mathcal{H}_x, \quad \dim(\mathcal{H}_x) = d < \infty$$

where $d$ is the internal degree of freedom dimension of a single cell.

**Corollaries**:

1. **Operators are Matrices**: All physical observables (position, momentum, Hamiltonian) are essentially $D \times D$ Hermitian matrices, not differential operators acting on function spaces. Differential operators are only approximations of matrices in the limit $D \to \infty$ (continuous limit).

2. **Discreteness of Position Spectrum**: Since $\mathcal{H}$ is finite-dimensional, position operator $\hat{x}$ can only have finitely many eigenvalues. This directly leads to spatial discretization (Lattice Structure).

3. **Breaking of Continuous Symmetries**: Continuous Lie group symmetries such as rotation group $SO(3)$ or Lorentz group $SO(3,1)$ no longer strictly hold at microscopic foundation; they must be replaced by discrete subgroups or quantum group structures.

### 1.2.4 Geometry of State Space: Projective Hilbert Space $\mathbb{C}P^{D-1}$

After establishing finite-dimensional property, the geometric picture of physical states becomes exceptionally clear. A pure state of a finite-dimensional quantum system corresponds to a ray in complex vector space $\mathbb{C}^D$. The manifold of physical states is **Complex Projective Space**:

$$\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{H}) \cong \mathbb{C}P^{D-1}$$

This is a compact, simply connected Kähler Manifold.

**Reconstruction of Physical Meaning**:

* **Distance**: The Fubini-Study Metric on state space defines the "distinguishability" or distance between two quantum states, which will be discussed in detail in Chapter 2.

* **Volume**: The total volume of $\mathbb{C}P^{D-1}$ is finite. This means that all possible "configurations" of the universe, though astronomical in number, are not infinite.

* **Evolution**: Schrödinger equation describes unitary flow of state vectors on $\mathbb{C}P^{D-1}$. Since the manifold is compact, this evolution has Poincaré Recurrence properties, though recurrence time is extremely long.

Through Axiom A2, we eliminate the UV Divergence problem that has plagued physics for half a century in quantum field theory. In the framework constructed in this book, divergence never occurs because the integration upper limit is naturally cut off at Planck scale (corresponding to finite dimension $D$). Renormalization Group is no longer a patching tool to eliminate infinities, but a scale transformation mapping connecting microscopic discrete parameters with macroscopic continuous parameters.

At this point, we have completed the reconstruction of the "stage" of physical reality: from infinite continuum back to finite discrete algebraic structures. In the next section, we will explore how this discrete structure leads to complete failure of continuum hypothesis and its physical origin.
