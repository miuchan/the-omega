## Appendix D: Index of Symbols and Axioms

**(全书符号索引与公理列表)**

This book constructs a vast theoretical system involving mathematical languages from multiple domains including quantum information, differential geometry, operator algebras, and complex systems. For readers' convenience in cross-referencing, this appendix compiles core axioms, main theorems, and definitions of key physical symbols throughout the book.

### D.1 Core Axiomatic System

The theoretical edifice of this book is built on the following mutually supporting fundamental axioms. These axioms are not arbitrary assumptions, but minimal physical commitments made under the discrete ontology framework to reconcile contradictions between quantum mechanics and general relativity.

* **Axiom A1: Finite Information Density Axiom**

    * **Definition**: Physical reality consists of discrete information units. For any finite spatial volume $V$, the number of independent physical degrees of freedom $N(V)$ it contains is finite, and there exists a natural cutoff at Planck scale.

    * **Source**: Chapter 1, Section 1.1.

    * **Corollary**: Hilbert space is locally finite-dimensional; continuum is only an effective approximation.

* **Axiom A2: Finite Information Axiom**

    * **Definition**: The Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\text{phys}}$ of physical reality is isomorphic to a finite-dimensional vector space $\mathbb{C}^D$ over complex numbers on any compact spatial region.

    * **Source**: Chapter 1, Section 1.2.

    * **Corollary**: True infinities do not exist; UV divergences are naturally eliminated.

* **Axiom A3: Causal Locality Axiom**

    * **Definition**: The global update operator $U$ of QCA is composed of local rules; information propagation speed is limited by finite lattice step size (speed of light $c$).

    * **Source**: Chapter 3, Section 3.2.

    * **Corollary**: Light cone structure is strict; "action at a distance" is forbidden.

* **Axiom A4: Maximum Entanglement Equilibrium Axiom (MEEA)**

    * **Definition**: Under fixed causal geometric volume constraints, the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}$ of vacuum state is at local stationary (extremal) state.

    * **Source**: Chapter 12, Section 12.1.

    * **Corollary**: Einstein field equations $G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}$ are the equation of state for spacetime thermodynamics.

* **Axiom A5: Quantum Focusing Conjecture (QFC)**

    * **Definition**: For any null geodesic congruence, the generalized expansion scalar $\Theta$ is monotonically decreasing along affine parameter: $d\Theta/d\lambda \le 0$.

    * **Source**: Chapter 14, Section 14.3.

    * **Corollary**: Ensures validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSL) and stability of spacetime.

* **Axiom A6: Topological Reality of Consciousness Axiom**

    * **Definition**: True conscious agency is equivalent to the existence of a topologically protected $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Berry phase (holonomy index $\nu=1$) in the physical carrier.

    * **Source**: Chapter 28, Section 28.2.

    * **Corollary**: Consciousness is an objective physical state, not merely computational function.
