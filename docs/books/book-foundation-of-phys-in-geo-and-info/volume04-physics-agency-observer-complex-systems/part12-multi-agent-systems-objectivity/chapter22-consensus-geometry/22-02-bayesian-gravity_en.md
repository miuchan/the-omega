**22.2 Bayesian Gravity: Observer Model Synchronization Driven by Relative Entropy Minimization**

In Section 22.1, we revealed failure of "absolute objectivity" through Wigner's friend paradox: physical reality is not an a priori given single state, but a **Relational** property of information in observer networks. This raises a profound dynamical question: since each observer has its own private algebra $\mathcal{A}_{\text{int}}$ and subjective model, why don't we live in countless mutually disconnected illusion bubbles? What force "pulls" these discrete subjective perspectives together, forming a coherent, shared objective spacetime?

This section will propose **Bayesian Gravity** hypothesis. We will prove that gravitational interactions in general relativity, at the bottom level of information geometry, are **Statistical Flows** generated by observers to eliminate **Cognitive Dissonance**—i.e., relative entropy. Gravity is not a force pulling objects, but a **tendency to pull together ideas (models)**.

### 22.2.1 Cognitive Distance and Disagreement Functional

Consider two neighboring observers $O_A$ and $O_B$ in QCA networks. They each possess internal predictive models $\rho_A$ and $\rho_B$ for the same spacetime region (causal diamond $\Sigma$) (defined on their respective internal algebras, mapped to public boundary algebra $\mathcal{A}_{\partial}$ through communication channels).

**Definition 22.2.1 (Cognitive Distance)**

Cognitive distance between observers $A$ and $B$ is defined as **Quantum Relative Entropy** of their prediction distributions about public events:

$$
D_{AB} \equiv S(\rho_A \| \rho_B) = \text{Tr}(\rho_A \ln \rho_A - \rho_A \ln \rho_B)
$$

This quantity is asymmetric, measuring "surprise" or model correction cost when $A$ receives $B$'s data.

**Definition 22.2.2 (Network-Wide Disagreement Functional)**

For entire observer network $\mathcal{G} = \{O_i\}$, system's **Total Cognitive Potential** is weighted sum of relative entropy on all connection channels:

$$
\mathcal{V}_{\text{cog}}[\{\rho_i\}] = \sum_{(i,j) \in E} w_{ij} S(\rho_i \| \rho_j)
$$

where $w_{ij}$ is communication weight (coupling strength), depending on causal distance or channel bandwidth between observers.

### 22.2.2 Bayesian Update as Gradient Flow

According to free energy principle (Section 19.3), each observer's dynamical goal is to minimize its own prediction error. In multi-agent environments, this means each observer continuously corrects its model $\rho_i$ to reduce disagreement with neighbors $\rho_j$ (i.e., minimize $\mathcal{V}_{\text{cog}}$).

**Theorem 22.2.1 (Bayesian Gravity Flow)**

In continuous time limit, if observers follow optimal rules of Bayesian inference (Bayes' Rule), evolution trajectory of their internal states $\rho_i$ on statistical manifold $\mathcal{S}$ follows **gradient flow equation**:

$$
\frac{d\theta^a_i}{dt} = - g^{ab}(\theta_i) \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta^b_i} \sum_j w_{ij} S(\rho(\theta_i) \| \rho(\theta_j))
$$

where $\theta^a_i$ are model parameters, $g^{ab}$ is inverse matrix of **Fisher Information Metric**.

This equation is isomorphic in form to **Geodesic Deviation Equation** (or force motion equation) in general relativity:

* **Fisher Metric $g_{ab}$** plays the role of **Spacetime Metric $g_{\mu\nu}$**.

* **Relative Entropy Gradient $\nabla S$** plays the role of **Gravitational Potential Gradient $\nabla \Phi$**.

**Physical Interpretation**:

When observer $A$ finds its prediction inconsistent with $B$ ($S(\rho_A \| \rho_B) > 0$), Bayesian update drives $A$ to modify parameters, making its state $\rho_A$ **"fall"** toward $\rho_B$.

This "mutual attraction" in information geometry space manifests as universal gravitation in macroscopic physics. **Objects attract each other because information they carry attempts to reach consensus**.

### 22.2.3 Origin of Mass: Inertia of Belief

Why are some objects (large mass) difficult to move, while others (small mass) easy? In Bayesian gravity, this corresponds to **Inertia of Belief**.

**Definition 22.2.3 (Informational Mass)**

Observer's "mass" $M_i$ is defined as **Precision** or **Inverse Variance** of its internal prior distribution.

$$
M_i \propto \text{Tr}(g_{ab}(\theta_i)) \approx \text{Fisher Information Content}
$$

* **Large Mass (High Precision)**: Observer possesses vast historical data or extremely strong prior beliefs (such as black holes or stars). When interacting with low-precision observers (test particles), large-mass observer almost does not change its state ($\Delta \theta \approx 0$), forcing the other to significantly correct its model.

* **Small Mass (Low Precision)**: Observer is uncertain about its own state (such as electrons or photons). It is easily "pulled" toward large-mass observer's model.

This explains **Equivalence Principle**: inertial mass (ability to resist model updates) and gravitational mass (ability to pull others to update models) both stem from the same statistical quantity—Fisher information content.

### 22.2.4 Emergence of General Relativity: From Consensus to Curvature

If all observers mutually "fall" and reach consensus, what is the final state?

**Theorem 22.2.2 (Consensus Manifold Theorem)**

Under long-term evolution of Bayesian flow, observer network tends toward a **Nash Equilibrium State**. In this equilibrium state, local metrics $g^{(i)}_{ab}$ of all observers patch together into a globally smooth Riemannian manifold $(\mathcal{M}, g_{\mu\nu})$.

Curvature $R_{\mu\nu}$ of this manifold corresponds to **residual, irreducible Information Tension** in the network.

* **Flat Spacetime ($R=0$)**: All observers completely agree, no information pressure in network.

* **Curved Spacetime ($R \neq 0$)**: Due to topological constraints or matter distribution, observers cannot achieve global agreement (e.g., around black holes). Although local consensus is reached, after parallel transporting model parameters around a closed loop, offset occurs (holonomy). This **Failure of Consensus** is precisely the definition of **Curvature**.

**Corollary 22.2.3 (Bayesian Interpretation of Einstein Equations)**

Einstein field equations $G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}$ can be restated as:

**Curvature of Consensus (Geometric Tension) is Proportional to Flux of Information (Material Tension).**

Matter ($T_{\mu\nu}$) is the source of information, continuously injecting new "surprise" into the network, disrupting consensus. Gravity ($G_{\mu\nu}$) is geometric deformation generated by the network to digest this surprise and restore local balance.

**Summary**

This section proposed Bayesian gravity theory, reducing universal gravitation to **Bayesian model synchronization mechanism** in multi-agent systems.

1. **Force as Update**: Gravity is statistical tendency of observers to correct models to minimize relative entropy.

2. **Mass as Belief**: Inertia is rigidity of prior probability distributions.

3. **Spacetime as Consensus**: Objective physical world is the greatest common divisor reached by countless subjective worlds through continuous games and calibration.

This view completely eliminates opposition between "subjective" and "objective": **Objectivity is just the limiting form of Intersubjectivity**.

In the next section 22.3, we will explore stability of this consensus mechanism, i.e., how **Objective Reality as Nash Equilibrium** is locked in game-theoretic framework.
