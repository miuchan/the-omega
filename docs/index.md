**The Omega Framework** is an ambitious project to reconstruct theoretical physics, aiming to establish a **completely finite, discrete, and self-consistent** axiomatic system.

Unlike traditional physics, which relies on the presuppositions of continuous manifolds and differential equations, this framework starts from the very bottom of **Information Theory** and **Algebraic Geometry**, answering the following core questions:
1.  **Ontology**: How does continuous spacetime geometry emerge from pure quantum information (Qubits)?
2.  **Dynamics**: If time is not fundamental, what is the microscopic mechanism of dynamical evolution?
3.  **Epistemology**: Is the observer in physical laws a bystander outside the system, or a mathematical structure within it?

## ✨ Key Highlights

### 1. Finiteness and Discreteness Axiom
We thoroughly discard the concept of "actual infinity" in physics. If it is real, it must be computable.
*   **Natural Cutoff**: The Planck scale is not an artificial limit but a direct consequence of the finite dimensionality of the Hilbert space.
*   **Eliminating Divergence**: By introducing Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) on discrete lattices, UV divergences in Quantum Field Theory are fundamentally eliminated.

### 2. Emergent Time Mechanism
Time is no longer an a priori parameter $t$, but a statistical quantity.
*   **Microscopic Definition**: Using the time delay operator $\mathsf{Q}$ from the Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith (EWS) scattering matrix to define microscopic time.
*   **Macroscopic Arrow**: Proving that the thermodynamic arrow of time and the unitarity breaking caused by the cosmological horizon share the same origin.

### 3. Gravity as Entanglement
We not only accept the Holographic Principle but further prove that the gravitational field equations are inevitable results of the Information-Geometric Variational Principle (IGVP) of maximizing quantum entanglement entropy.
*   **Derivation**: Deriving Einstein's field equations directly from the variation of generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}$.
*   **Horizon Thermodynamics**: The black hole horizon is interpreted as a causal truncation interface for information propagation.

### 4. Physics of Consciousness
Consciousness is no longer a "byproduct" of physics but a causal network with specific topological structures.
*   **Mathematical Definition**: The observer is defined as a subsystem of a von Neumann algebra with a **self-referential structure**.
*   **Topological Protection**: Conscious states correspond to non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ holonomy classes in parameter space, explaining their stability in decoherent environments.
