**The Omega Framework** is an ambitious project to reconstruct theoretical physics, aiming to establish a **completely finite, discrete, and self-consistent** axiomatic system.

Unlike traditional physics, which relies on the presuppositions of continuous manifolds and differential equations, this framework starts from the very bottom of **Information Theory** and **Algebraic Geometry**, answering the following core questions:
1.  **Ontology**: How does continuous spacetime geometry emerge from pure quantum information (Qubits)?
2.  **Dynamics**: If time is not fundamental, what is the microscopic mechanism of dynamical evolution?
3.  **Epistemology**: Is the observer in physical laws a bystander outside the system, or a mathematical structure within it?

## ✨ Key Highlights

### 1. Finiteness and Discreteness Axiom
We thoroughly discard the concept of "actual infinity" in physics. If it is real, it must be computable.
*   **Natural Cutoff**: The Planck scale is not an artificial limit but a direct consequence of the finite dimensionality of the Hilbert space.
*   **Eliminating Divergence**: By introducing Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) on discrete lattices, UV divergences in Quantum Field Theory are fundamentally eliminated.

### 2. Emergent Time Mechanism
Time is no longer an a priori parameter $t$, but a statistical quantity.
*   **Microscopic Definition**: Using the time delay operator $\mathsf{Q}$ from the Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith (EWS) scattering matrix to define microscopic time.
*   **Macroscopic Arrow**: Proving that the thermodynamic arrow of time and the unitarity breaking caused by the cosmological horizon share the same origin.

### 3. Gravity as Entanglement
We not only accept the Holographic Principle but further prove that the gravitational field equations are inevitable results of the Information-Geometric Variational Principle (IGVP) of maximizing quantum entanglement entropy.
*   **Derivation**: Deriving Einstein's field equations directly from the variation of generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}$.
*   **Horizon Thermodynamics**: The black hole horizon is interpreted as a causal truncation interface for information propagation.

### 4. Physics of Consciousness
Consciousness is no longer a "byproduct" of physics but a causal network with specific topological structures.
*   **Mathematical Definition**: The observer is defined as a subsystem of a von Neumann algebra with a **self-referential structure**.
*   **Topological Protection**: Conscious states correspond to non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ holonomy classes in parameter space, explaining their stability in decoherent environments.

## 📚 Book Overview

This project hosts two core texts, tracing the derivation from abstract axioms to physical reality.

### [📘 Book 1: Foundation of Physics in Geometry and Information](./books/book-foundation-of-phys-in-geo-and-info/index_en.md)
*The original manuscript establishing the 5-volume framework.*

#### Volume I: Discrete Ontology — Physical Foundations of Information
> **A Rigorous Proof of "It from Bit"**
This volume establishes the "assembly language" of physics. We prove that continuous Riemannian geometry can naturally emerge from the distinguishability of discrete quantum states (Fubini-Study metric).
*   **Key Chapters**: Holographic Principle, Information Geometry, Quantum Cellular Automata, Discretization of Field Theory.

#### Volume II: Emergence of Time — Scattering, Thermodynamics, and Dynamics
> **Time is What Happens, Not the Background of What Happens**
This volume challenges the absolute status of time, reconstructing it as phase delay in scattering processes.
*   **Key Chapters**: Scattering Time Delay Theory, Spectral-Scattering Duality, Unified Time Identity, Discrete Time Crystals.

#### Volume III: Entropic Origin of Gravity and Geometry
> **Spacetime is the Fabric of Quantum Entanglement**
This volume reduces General Relativity to thermodynamic laws.
*   **Key Chapters**: Causal Geometry, Entropic Variational Principle, Information Origin of Energy Conditions, Microscopic Statistics of Black Holes, Geometric Unification of Interactions.

#### Volume IV: Physics of Agency — Observers and Complex Systems
> **The Observer is the Mathematical Eye of the Universe's Self-Cognition**
This volume marks physics' advance into cognitive science, finding a physical foothold for "agency".
*   **Key Chapters**: Algebraic Structure of Observers, Self-Referential Dynamics, Topological Physics of Consciousness, Consensus Geometry.

#### Volume V: Metatheory — Logic, Computation, and Experimental Verification
> **Ultimate Self-Consistency and Verification of the Theory**
This volume uses Category Theory to unify the above theories and proposes falsifiable experimental schemes.
*   **Key Chapters**: Categorical Quantum Mechanics, Optimality of Physical Computation, Precision Measurement Experiments (Gravitational Wave Dispersion, Microwave Scattering).

### [📙 Book 2: First Principles: From Unitary Computation to Physical Reality](./books/book-first-principles-from-unitary-computation-to-physical-reality/index_en.md)
*A reconstruction from first principles, focusing on the derivation from QCA.*

#### Part 1: The Birth of Axioms
> **The Universe as a Finite State Machine**
We establish the ultimate axiom $\Omega$: The Universe is a Quantum Cellular Automaton (QCA).
*   **Key Concepts**: Zeno's Paradox, Bekenstein Bound, Graph $\Lambda$, Hilbert Space $\mathcal{H}$, Unitary Operator $\hat{U}$.

#### Part 2: The Emergence of Spacetime
> **Geometry is the Data Structure of Entanglement**
We derive Lorentz invariance and Gravity from pure information processing dynamics.
*   **Key Concepts**: Light Path Conservation ($v_{ext}^2 + v_{int}^2 = c^2$), Entropic Gravity (IGVP), Black Hole knots.

#### Part 3: The Emergence of Matter
> **Particles are Topological Defects in the Logic**
Matter is not distinct from spacetime but a "knot" in the computational substrate.
*   **Key Concepts**: Mass as Impedance ($v_{int}$), Topological Winding Numbers, Gauge Fields from Link Variables.

#### Part 4: The Emergence of Observation
> **The Loop of Self-Reference**
We explain how a deterministic system generates probabilistic observations and subjective experience.
